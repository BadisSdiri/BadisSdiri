Hey there! I’m Badis Sdiri, an engineer passionate about solving technical challenges and leading teams to success. 
Whether it’s tackling complex systems or pushing boundaries in AI and robotics, I’m driven by innovation and getting things done right.

With an engineer’s degree in Mechatronics and a specialty in energy and naval systems, 
I’ve spent the last 2.5 years keeping machines running smoothly, ships sailing safely, and teams working like clockwork – 
all while secretly trying to get robots to do my laundry (spoiler: still working on that one).

Currently, as the Head of Energy and Propulsion Services at the National Navy, I manage a fantastic team of maintenance agents who make sure everything stays shipshape (pun intended). 
I ensure preventive maintenance, schedule repairs, and test propulsion systems, all while making sure things don’t blow up – literally.

But wait, there’s more! When I’m not overseeing complex systems, I’m diving into AI and machine learning, especially in the realm of genomic analysis. 
I’ve worked on cool projects like turning DNA sequences into sound signals (no, they don’t play your favorite tunes, but close) and using machine learning to predict things like Parkinson’s disease. 
I’ve also dabbled in real-time image processing for facial recognition (no, I don’t spy on people… much).
